Bible translations/versions
---------------------------

This app natively uses *.yes* files for the Bible text. You can create a *.yes* file easily by preparing a plain text file. See [this page for](http://www.bibleforandroid.com/developer) instructions.

You can also convert PalmBible+ PDB files using the built-in converter in the app or use the [pdb2yes online converter](http://pdb2yes.alkitab-host.appspot.com/) that produces compressed YES files.

Customizing and Integrating
---------------------------

Bible for Android is not only open-source, but also designed in a flexible manner. Not only you can read, learn and meditate with the app, but you can extend it to include your own resources, as well as getting and displaying verses from your own apps.

See the [Developer page](http://www.bibleforandroid.com/developer) for more information.
